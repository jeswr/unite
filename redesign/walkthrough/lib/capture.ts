/**
 * Screen capture of one Chromium tab via the DevTools screencast, streamed into ffmpeg
 * as a constant-frame-rate H.264 video. Playwright's built-in recordVideo is capped at a
 * low bitrate; this keeps text sharp at 1080p.
 *
 * Chromium only sends a frame when something changes, so a ticker repeats the latest
 * frame to hold a steady frame rate against the wall clock. The video's timeline is
 * therefore real time since start(), which the recorder uses to place the narration.
 *
 * Frames reach us some time after Chromium painted them, and longer when the machine is
 * busy. Each frame is placed at the time it was painted (the screencast's own
 * timestamp), not when it arrived: the ticker writes a short while behind real time so
 * late frames still land where they belong. Otherwise the picture would lag the
 * narration by however long frames took to arrive.
